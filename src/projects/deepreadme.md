A research assistant powered by LLMs that generates readmes and executes code. My Final Year Project (FYP).

## Features

- **Readme Generation**: Automatically generates documentation from code repositories
- **Code Execution**: Safe execution environment for running and testing code
- **LLM Agent**: Intelligent assistant powered by large language models
- **RAG Integration**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for better context understanding
- **Research Assistant**: Helps researchers understand and document codebases

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **Readme Generator**: Analyzes code repositories and generates comprehensive documentation
2. **Code Executor**: Safe sandboxed environment for executing and validating code snippets

## Tech Stack

- **AI/ML**: LLM agents with LangChain
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for context-aware responses
- **Backend**: Python for agent orchestration
- **Code Execution**: Sandboxed execution environment

## Status

Currently in development as Final Year Project (FYP). Work in progress.
